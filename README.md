Web scraping folio

Description

Here you can see my web scraping projects.
I made two works:

RTX 4070 Ti SUPER â†’ tracked on Amazon and LDLC with a Tkinter interface.

Electric scooters â†’ scraped on Cdiscount, with product details saved into an Excel file.

Both projects were built in Python using:

BeautifulSoup (bs4) â†’ HTML parsing

Selenium â†’ dynamic web scraping

OpenPyXL â†’ saving results in .xlsx files

Tkinter â†’ simple desktop GUI for the RTX tracker
